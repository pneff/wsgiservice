If you want to install the current live version of WsgiService just type the
following command on the command line (you probably want to execute this
inside a virtualenv):

    easy_install WsgiService


DEVELOPMENT
===========

To install a development version, first check out WsgiService from somewhere.
The current master fork is the git repository maintained by Patrice Neff at
<git://github.com/pneff/wsgiservice.git>.

After checking out, type the following command:

    python setup.py develop

You need setuptools for this to work.
If the installation directory is a system-owned directory (for instance,
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages), then you need to run the above command
as root.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

To build the documentation first install Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>.
Then execute:

    cd docs
    make html

The documentation is generated in the directory `_build/html/index.html`.
